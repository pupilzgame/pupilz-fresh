## Key Game Mechanics

### Level Progression Flow
1. **Level 1**: Kill 2 ships → green "LVL 2" ring spawns → fly through
2. **Level 2-4**: Same pattern with 3, 4, 5 ships respectively  
3. **Level 5**: Kill 5 ships → green "LVL 5" ring → boss spawns
4. **Boss Fight**: Defeat boss → dramatic pause → EARTH ring → victory

### Balance & Rewards
- **Start**: 0 nukes, 0 energy cells (pure skill focus)
- **Level Rewards**: 3 drone escorts per level (defensive progression)
- **Pickups**: 8% chance for nukes after Level 2, energy cells
- **Emergency Safety**: Last life + no nukes = automatic nuke

### 🎯 AAA Scoring System
- **Scalable Architecture**: Base points × type multiplier × size multiplier × level multiplier
- **Enemy Values**: Asteroids (10), Barriers (20), Ships (100), Boss (1000)
- **Level Scaling**: Multipliers increase with progression (1.0x → 3.0x+)
- **Bonus Points**: Level completion, survival time, life bonus, victory bonus
- **Visual Feedback**: Floating "+XXX" popups appear at destruction sites
- **Complete Coverage**: All kill methods award points (player, drones, kamikaze)
- **Final Score**: Comprehensive calculation displayed on victory/defeat screens

### 🎉 Victory Celebration System
- **Epic Confetti**: 50 colorful particles per wave, 8 waves over 8 seconds
- **Firework Bursts**: 7 timed explosions with 25 particles each across the screen
- **Rainbow Colors**: Gold, red, green, blue, orange, pink, purple, turquoise
- **Perfect Timing**: Synced with Earth reached music and victory message
- **Meme Potential**: 8-second duration ideal for screenshots and recordings

### Important State Flags
- `levelUpProcessed.current` - Prevents duplicate level advances
- `quotaJustMet.current` - Reset at game start for quota tracking
- `bossGateCleared.current` - Controls boss defeat → EARTH ring flow
- `ringRespawnPending.current` - Prevents duplicate ring respawn scheduling

## Critical Code Locations (App.tsx ~47k lines)

-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor for working leaderboard:
-- DEBUGGING SUPABASE LEADERBOARD SETUP
-- This script temporarily disables RLS for testing

-- Step 1: Clean slate (remove any broken table)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS leaderboard CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Create the table with all required columns
CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  player_name text NOT NULL,
  score integer NOT NULL,
  level integer NOT NULL,
  victory boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  achievements text[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::text[]
);

-- Step 3: Add sample data
INSERT INTO leaderboard (player_name, score, level, victory, achievements) VALUES
('ACE', 125000, 5, true, ARRAY['EARTH_REACHED', 'CENTURION']),
('TOP', 89500, 4, false, ARRAY['BOSS_FIGHTER']),
('PRO', 67200, 3, false, ARRAY[]::text[]),
('FLY', 45800, 2, false, ARRAY[]::text[]),
('NEW', 12300, 1, false, ARRAY[]::text[]);

-- Step 4: DISABLE RLS for testing (temporarily)
-- This removes all security restrictions for debugging
ALTER TABLE leaderboard DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 5: Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX ON leaderboard (score DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON leaderboard (created_at DESC);

-- Step 6: Test that we can read and write
SELECT 'SUCCESS! Table created with ' || COUNT(*) || ' sample entries' as result FROM leaderboard;

-- Step 7: Test insert (this should work without RLS)
INSERT INTO leaderboard (player_name, score, level, victory, achievements)
VALUES ('TST', 999, 1, false, ARRAY[]::text[]);

SELECT 'INSERT TEST: Now has ' || COUNT(*) || ' entries' as insert_test FROM leaderboard;
```
